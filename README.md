# Full-Stack Web Application Project

## Project Overview

**Title:** *Solving the Crisis Invasion: The Parallel Journeys of Vietnam and Finland (2018–2025)*  

### Purpose:
This project addresses the conflict between quality and quantity in task management, focusing on creating an asynchronous, efficient, and cost-effective system. It helps users maintain independence during challenging situations such as wars, personal crises, or long-term stress, enabling both productivity and mental health improvement. 

## Key Features  

### Core Functionalities:
- **Tools**:  
  - GitHub history for tracking progress.  
  - Submission system for performance validation.  
  - SMS phone book integration for task notifications.  
  - ChatGPT for brainstorming and quick answers.  
  - CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.  

### **Authority Review**  .
- **JWT and APIs**: Secure authentication using private and public keys to prevent fraud and unauthorized access.  
- **MongoDB**: Database management for login validation and data storage, with db.json as a starting point.
- **Fly.io**: Hosting backend services, enabling multi-port terminal operations.  
- **Docker Images & Visual Studio**: Fetch results faster and ensure consistency across environments.  
- **Private IP Management**: Using Visual Studio to handle actual private IPs for enhanced security.
- **Axios & RESTful APIs**: Streamlined communication between client and server with proper error handling (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found).  
- **Apollo Client Integration**: Enhancing real-time updates and facilitating efficient data fetching.  
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated workflows to track performance and ensure consistent task execution.
Feedback from reliable sources and stakeholders for improvement: Mehilainen, Posti, Monika, TE, Haaga Helia

### **User Insights**  
- **On JWT & APIs**: Using private and public keys helps confirm critical security information, preventing fraud and misuse of fake information that could lead to misunderstanding or unexpected outcomes."_  
- **On MongoDB**:"I prefer MongoDB as it allows me to clearly identify endpoints and access reliable sources for help."
- **On Visual Studio & Private IPs**:"Managing actual private IPs through Visual Studio has reduced confusion between fake and authentic information, giving me more confidence in my capabilities."_  
- **On Axios & Error Handling**:"This approach saves time by avoiding unnecessary brainstorming about potential issues, letting me confirm if I'm on the right track with authorities."_  
- **On Asynchronous/Synchronous Models**:"The asyn/syn model has significantly reduced delays in my workflow, even during unexpected family conflicts, allowing me to work efficiently despite limited support."_  
- **On GitHub Actions**:"GitHub Actions has been invaluable for keeping me on track and monitoring progress."_
