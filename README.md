# Full-Stack Web Application Project

## Project Overview

**Title:** Your Project Title Here, vì k muốn lãng quên mọi ng, dự án này nhằm đánh dấu sự hỗn loạn và trật tự

**Purpose:** This project is designed to solve the unsolvable question of quality vs. quantity. For example, instead of a long 200 km trip, we aim to reduce it to 80 km. The goal is to provide a strategy to reverse the battle by implementing an asynchronous, efficient, and low-cost system for task management. This will enhance productivity, minimize event loop delays, and improve mental health. How do you escape chaotic, unexpected , isolatte situations? How do you get out of a freeze duration? When everything aligns exactly as planned with real-time reports and authority reviews, it shows that the AL techniques being used are correct. I volunteer to help others who are stuck in a freeze duration due to war, chaos, getting lost in the forest, isolation, or being trapped. My goal is to help them transition from dependence to independence once again.
