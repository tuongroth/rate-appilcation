# Full-Stack Web Application Project

## Project Overview

**Title:** *Solving the Crisis Invasion: The Parallel Journeys of Vietnam and Finland (2018-2025)*

### Purpose:
This project is designed to address the conflict between quality and quantity. By reducing long trips (e.g., from 2000m/s to 80m/s), it aims to implement an asynchronous, efficient, and low-cost task management system to improve productivity and mental health. The system will help users navigate chaotic, isolating, or "frozen" situations—such as those caused by war, isolation, or personal struggles—and transition from dependence to independence.

### Key Features:

- **Asynchronous Task Handling:**
  - Tasks are managed out of order, with easy-to-complete actions prioritized to maintain momentum.
  - Real-time updates ensure tasks evolve dynamically.

- **Progress Visualization:**
  - Visualizes task completion and pending tasks in real time.
  - Authority reviews and feedback ensure validation.

- **Low-Effort Workflow:**
  - Breaks tasks into small, manageable chunks to avoid overwhelming the user.

- **Adaptive Timeline:**
  - Dynamic timeline adapts to real-world challenges and mental health needs.
  - Especially useful for individuals experiencing PTSD or long-term stress.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Simplified design for accessibility, including users with little technical expertise.

- **Mental Health Support:**
  - Incorporates strategies for reducing anxiety and avoiding decision paralysis.
  - Promotes confidence and efficiency in task management.

### Technology Stack:
- **Frontend:** React Vite
- **Backend:** Node.js Axios
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Deployment:** Frontend on Netlify or Vercel; Backend on Heroku or Render.
